This project is following the HTML, advanced project

For this project, you will focus on the CSS and the style of the page.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:

And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details. (if not already done)



Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesn’t have the fonts used, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md and create an index.html file from the HTML code provided in the HTML, advanced concept page (also embedded below).
